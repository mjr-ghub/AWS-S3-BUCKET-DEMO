# AWS-S3-BUCKET-DEMO
A simple end to end project on creating aws s3 bucket and manage bucket policies to restrict access

S3 Buckets:- S3 buckets are containers for storing objects (files) in Amazon S3. Each bucket has a unique name globally across all of AWS. You can think of an S3 bucket as a top-level folder that holds your data.

Creating an S3 bucket:- To create an S3 bucket, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), or AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits). You need to specify a globally unique bucket name and select the region where you want to create the bucket.

S3 bucket policies:- Create and manage bucket policies to control access to your S3 buckets. Bucket policies are written in JSON and define permissions for various actions and resources.
